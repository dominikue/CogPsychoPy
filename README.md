## About CogPsychoPy

<!-- ![Screen Shot](images/screenshot.png) -->
<!-- Only using code -->

* Your time should be focused on creating an amazing experiment and not studying the PsychoPy documentation.
* Easy to refactor and scaling for complex experiments
* You should element [DRY principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself) to the rest of your life :smile:

- [X] Using psychopys Handlers: [TrialHandler](https://psychopy.org/coder/codeTrials.html) and ExperimentHandler
- [x] Using an yml file for the experiment config and conditions: Human readable and easy to edit
- [x] Export the data using psychopy: [CSV, Log file, and backup .psydata](https://www.psychopy.org/general/dataOutputs.html)
- [ ] Template for using the staircase handler: QuestPlus example
- [ ] How to test experiments: [PsychoPy Runner](https://www.psychopy.org/runner/runner.html)

Of course, no one template will serve all experiments since your needs may be different. Feel free to suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue.

A list of commonly used resources that I find helpful are listed in the acknowledgements.

*Built With* [PsychoPy](https://github.com/psychopy/psychopy).
