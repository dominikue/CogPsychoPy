n_repeats: 1

# Number of repeats for each parameter combination: 
#   total_trials = n_repeats * parameters_combinations
method: random
# Presents the conditions in the order they appear in the experiment
#   - 'random' will result in a shuffle of the conditions on each repeat,
#   - 'sequential' presents the conditions in the same order on each repeat,
#      but all conditionsoccur once before the second repeat etc. 
#   - 'fullRandom' fully randomises the trials across repeats as well,
#      which means you could potentially run all trials of
#      one condition before any trial of another.
parameters:
# parameters for the experiment
#   for each parameter, the value is a list of values
#   the experiment will be run for each combination of values 
  weigth: [1.5, 2]  # weight of the condition
  distance: [100]  # distance in pixels
